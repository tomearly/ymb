	Part of being a Beauty Therapist is having the ability to be able to listen, comfort, and reassure my clients as having a physical treatment plays a huge part on how they feel mentally and emotionally. And Iâ€™m all for making someone feel better be it giving them silky smooth legs, well painted toes or taking the tension away with a massage.
